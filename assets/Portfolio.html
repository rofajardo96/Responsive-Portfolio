                     Hey! My name is Rob and here are a few things I would like to share with you:
                     I am 23 years old and was born in Bogotá, Colombia. While I consider Colombia to be home, I moved to Ecuador when I was 2, moved to Orlando, FL a year later, and lived there until I moved to São Paulo, Brazil for my junior and senior year of high school. 
                     While this semi-nomadic lifestyle can be difficult at times, it has also been incredibly rewarding. Throughout all the different moves I also had the opportunity to visit over 30 different countries. Each country I have been to has given me a handful of wonderful memories and served as an invaluavble learning experience.
                     In addition to my traveling, I am a recent college graduate from Northeastern University with a B.S. in Political Science and a minor in Business Administration. In order to further expand the tools at my disposal, 
                     and because it's just a very cool field of work, I am also trying to dive into the world of coding and web development. I can't say I know exactly where this path will take me, but I am more than fine with adding another adventure to the books.
